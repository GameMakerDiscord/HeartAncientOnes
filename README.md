the player manages the chorazos cult, attempting to awaken yog-sothoth

### gameplay

<3 ancient ones is heavily inspired by worker placement board games, and behaves similar to one.
the player is playing against the church attempting to awaken their old god before the church is able to seal the portal between worlds.

each turn, the player attempts to sacrifice more villagers to the portal. 
the black church gets its money through nefarious means

the player has a limited amount of priests they can house at the church, and a limited amount of bodies can be stored, use the mason to dig a deeper crypt for more 

there's a turn limit before the church is successful in eliminating the portal. ransacking the church and spreading fear lessen the church's progress

each day, citizens, priests, and zealots move around in the city.
each day is 3 turns - morning, day, night
5 days per week - 5th day is holy day
game length determined in weeks
